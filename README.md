# Forecasting-of-Time-Series
Time Series Forecasting with Random Forest  This project utilizes Random Forest regression to predict the next day's value in a synthetic time series dataset. It includes visualization of the time series, model training with appropriate parameters, evaluation using Mean Squared Error, and dataset splitting into 80% training and 20% testing sets.


## Time Series Forecasting with Random Forest

Best Window Size: 12
Corresponding MSE: 0.25441872223154616
Final Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.25441872223154616

## Instructions:
To run the time series forecasting model, follow these steps:

Run window_size_finder.py to determine the best window size for your dataset.
Use the obtained best window size to run last.py for time series forecasting.
